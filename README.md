## Optimized Binary Search Algorithm

### Overview

This project implements an optimized binary search algorithm that aims to reduce the average case time complexity to O(log(logn)). Traditional binary search has an average case of O(logn), but this approach further optimizes the guessing process, leading to improved performance in scenarios where constant factors matter.

### Approach

The core idea behind this optimized binary search is to dynamically adjust the guess index based on the remaining search space. The algorithm calculates an `avg_var` to determine the average variation between elements in the current search space. The guess index is then updated using this variation, resulting in a more efficient guessing process.

### Example

Consider a sorted array:

```
Index No: 0 1 2 3 4 5
Element:  1 2 3 4 5 6
```

Let's search for the element 4 (x=4).

1. **1st Iteration:**
   - `avg_var = (6-1)/5 = 1`
   - `guess_index = (4-1)/1 + 1 = 4`
   - Since `a[guess_index] > x`, update `high` to `4-1=3`.
   - Check again, and update `low` to `0+(3-0)/2 = 1`.

2. **2nd Iteration:**
   - `avg_var = (4-2)/2 = 1`
   - `guess_index = (4-2)/1 + 1 = 3`
   - `a[guess_index]` is now equal to the target value (`x`), and the element is found.

### Code Snippet

```cpp
int avg_var = (a[high] - a[low]) / (high - low);
int guess_index = ((value - a[low]) / avg_var) + low;
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this optimized binary search algorithm is O(log(logn)) on average. The dynamic adjustment of the guess index based on the variation in the search space contributes to faster convergence to the target element.

### Usage

1. Include the necessary headers: `#include<bits/stdc++.h>` and `using namespace std;`.
2. Input the size of the array `n` and the sorted elements.
3. Specify the value to search for using `int value; cin >> value;`.
4. The `solve()` function performs the optimized binary search.

### Conclusion

This algorithm offers improved average-case performance over traditional binary search algorithms. However, it's important to consider the characteristics of the input data and the specific use case to determine its suitability. Experimentation and profiling may be necessary to assess the algorithm's performance in different scenarios.
